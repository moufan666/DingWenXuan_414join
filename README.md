WELCOME TO MY LITTLE WORLD!
==
Hello!I'm `DingWenxuan`.Nice to meet youÔºÅXD
- 
I'm a `painter` from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
who came to this school in order to have `a higher level of training in the art industry`.<br>
Besides, I also hope to learn some programming skills and game theory to create a world for the `characters` born under my pen.<br>
Having said that, I am actually very interested in everything about this major.
