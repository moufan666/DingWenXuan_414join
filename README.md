:sparkles:WELCOME TO MY LITTLE WORLD!:sparkles:
==
Hello!I'm `DingWenxuan`. Nice to meet youÔºÅXD:smiley_cat:
- 
I'm a `painter` from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
who came to this school in order to have `a higher level of training in the art industry`. To fill my regret of not being able to study art and to follow my dream.<br>
I hope I can meet reliable and good students in `414` and be at the top of the profession!(exaggerated) I also want to learn everything about this profession, such as game fundamentals and programming, and I want to create my own game world for the `characters` born under my pen.<br>

I usually paint Impasto with `Impasto`. I personally prefer cool colors, but I need some warm colors in a lot of cool colors. so I painted her eyes pink, and I also used a lot of hidden color techniques, which is what I am particularly good at.

This is a `sketch` of my cartoon image, To prove that impasto is not the only thing I'm good at.
