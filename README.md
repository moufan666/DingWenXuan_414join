:sparkles:WELCOME TO MY LITTLE WORLD!:sparkles:
==
Hello!I'm `DingWenxuan`. Nice to meet youÔºÅXD:smiley_cat:
- 
I'm a `painter` from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
who came to this school in order to have `a higher level of training in the art industry`.To fill my regret of not being able to study art and to follow my dream<br>
Besides, I also hope to learn some programming skills and game theory to create a world for the `characters` born under my pen.<br>
Having said that, I am actually very interested in everything about this major.
#  This is my favorite picture of my lovely cat. she is my angel.
